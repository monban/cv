This is a quick Rails application to manage my résumé (or [cv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae) if you prefer).

In the future I'd like to add support for managing multiple résumés, but that would be just for fun, I don't plan on starting a website to compete with Monster or similar.
